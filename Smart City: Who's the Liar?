## 🔍 Question 1: Who talks to whom?

**Scenario:**  
It’s 6:00 PM. Air quality is dropping in the city center. A Smart City system responds automatically.

**Involved devices:**  
1. 🚦 Traffic light  
2. 🌫️ Pollution sensor  
3. 🚌 Transport management system  
4. 📡 Weather station  
5. 🏙️ Central city server  

**Question:**  
What is the correct logical order of communication between these devices to reduce traffic and improve air quality?

> 🧠 Hint: Think detection → analysis → action

## 🕵️‍♂️ Question 2: Who is lying?

**Scenario:**  
A fire is suspected in a residential neighborhood. Several devices send data to the control center.

**Received data:**  
1. 🔥 Smoke detector: "Smoke detected at 5:42 PM."  
2. 💧 Humidity sensor: "Ambient humidity is very high."  
3. 🌡️ Temperature sensor: "Ambient temperature: 85°C."  
4. 👁️ Surveillance camera: "No anomaly detected."  
5. 🚒 Water pressure sensor: "Sprinkler system pressure: 0 bar."

**Question:**  
Which device is likely sending inconsistent information?
